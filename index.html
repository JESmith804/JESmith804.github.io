    <h5>Thousands of beer lovers across America celebrate April 7th every year as National Beer Day, but unless you’ve seen this video from Buffalo Wild Wings–the birthplace of the holiday–you won’t know that the holiday resulted from the efforts of one man in particular.
        The video celebrates Justin Smith, the “godfather” of National Beer Day, whose mustachioed visage is enshrined behind the bar. The video is comedic, but the photo (and mustache) are real–as was Smith’s role in starting the holiday, which has been celebrated since 2009.</h5>
